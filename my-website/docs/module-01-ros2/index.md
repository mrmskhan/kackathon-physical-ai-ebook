# Module 1: ROS 2 Foundation

Welcome to Module 1! This module teaches you the fundamentals of ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), the industry-standard middleware for building robotic systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Install and configure ROS 2 Humble on Ubuntu 22.04
- Create ROS 2 nodes and understand the publish-subscribe pattern
- Implement inter-node communication using topics, services, and actions
- Model robot structures using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
- Visualize robot models in RViz2
- Write executable Python examples for publisher/subscriber, service client/server, and action client/server patterns

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (physical or virtual machine)
- **Programming Experience**: Basic Python knowledge (variables, functions, classes)
- **Command Line**: Familiarity with bash terminal and basic Linux commands
- **Hardware**: Minimum 4GB RAM, 20GB free disk space

:::tip No Prior Robotics Experience Required
This module is designed for beginners. We'll explain all robotics concepts from scratch!
:::

## Estimated Time

**4-6 hours** to complete all lessons and hands-on examples

## Module Structure

This module consists of 4 progressive lessons:

1. **ROS 2 Installation** - Set up your development environment
2. **Nodes and Topics** - Master the publish-subscribe communication pattern
3. **Services and Actions** - Learn request-response and goal-based communication
4. **URDF Modeling** - Create robot descriptions and visualize in RViz2

## Hands-On Learning

Each lesson includes:

- **Conceptual Explanation** - Understand the "why" behind each concept
- **Executable Code Examples** - Copy-paste-run examples in the `examples/` directory
- **Mermaid Diagrams** - Visual architecture and data flow illustrations
- **Troubleshooting Tips** - Common errors and solutions

## What You'll Build

By the end of this module, you'll have:

- A working ROS 2 development environment
- 7 executable Python programs (publisher, subscriber, service client/server, action client/server)
- A basic humanoid URDF model visualized in RViz2
- Foundational knowledge for Modules 2-5 (Simulation, AI, VLA, Hardware)
