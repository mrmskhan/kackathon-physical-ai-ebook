# Module 2: Simulation Mastery

Welcome to Module 2! This module teaches you how to use simulation environments for physics-based testing and high-fidelity visualization of robotic systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Install and configure Gazebo Garden for physics simulation
- Create custom simulation worlds with obstacles and test environments
- Spawn robots with sensors (lidar, camera, IMU) in Gazebo
- Integrate Unity 2022.3 LTS for high-fidelity visualization
- Set up ROS-TCP-Connector bridge between Unity and ROS 2
- Build test arenas for navigation and manipulation tasks

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- **Completed**: Module 1 (ROS 2 Foundation) - URDF modeling skills required
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- **Hardware**: 8GB+ RAM recommended, GPU recommended for Unity
- **Software**: ROS 2 Humble installed and configured

:::tip Build on Module 1
This module uses the URDF models you created in Module 1. Make sure you've completed the ROS 2 Foundation module first!
:::

## Estimated Time

**6-8 hours** to complete all lessons and hands-on examples

## Module Structure

This module consists of 4 progressive lessons:

1. **Gazebo Garden Setup** - Install Gazebo and configure ROS 2 bridge
2. **Physics Simulation** - Master gravity, collisions, friction, and sensor plugins
3. **Unity Integration** - Set up Unity with ROS-TCP-Connector for visualization
4. **Environment Building** - Create custom worlds with stairs, doorways, and obstacles

## Hands-On Learning

Each lesson includes:

- **Conceptual Explanation** - Understand simulation fundamentals
- **Executable Code Examples** - SDF worlds, launch files, and Unity scripts
- **Mermaid Diagrams** - Gazebo-ROS and Unity-ROS integration architectures
- **Troubleshooting Tips** - Common simulation errors and solutions

## What You'll Build

By the end of this module, you'll have:

- A working Gazebo Garden simulation environment
- Custom simulation worlds with physics-based obstacles
- Unity scene integrated with ROS 2 via ROS-TCP-Connector
- Test arenas for navigation experiments in Module 3
- Experience with both lightweight (Gazebo) and high-fidelity (Unity) simulation

## Ready to Start?

Lessons for this module are coming soon! Stay tuned for comprehensive Gazebo and Unity simulation tutorials.
