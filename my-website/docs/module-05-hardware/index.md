# Module 5: Hardware Deployment

Deploy your VLA system on real humanoid robots.

## Learning Objectives

- Set up development workstation (RTX GPU, Ubuntu 22.04)
- Flash and configure NVIDIA Jetson Orin for edge deployment
- Integrate RealSense cameras and IMU sensors
- Interface with humanoid robot platforms (Unitree, ROBOTIS)

## Prerequisites

- Completed Modules 1-4
- Access to hardware (workstation + optional robot)
- Budget: $2,000-$5,000 for full setup

## Time Estimate

8-10 hours (workstation setup + sensor integration)

## Note

This module is **optional** for simulation-only learners. All previous modules work entirely in Gazebo without physical hardware.

## Hardware Tiers

**Tier 1 (Required)**: Development workstation only
**Tier 2 (Recommended)**: Workstation + RealSense camera
**Tier 3 (Advanced)**: Workstation + Jetson + robot platform

## Next Steps
